An interface contains method declarations and serves as literally an interface between a
class inheriting that interface and the other classes. Unlike a class, an interface can extend
multiple interfaces, and a class can implement multiple interfaces.

The keyword abstract before a method means that the method does not have a body, it
just declares a signature.

A class can implement multiple interfaces.

An interface can extend one or more other interfaces using the keyword extends.

A class can also extend another class and implement multiple interfaces.
